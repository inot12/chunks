First-class object
------------------
there are no restrictions on the object's use. It's the same as any other object.
'in python, everything is an object' -> this implies that everything is a 'first-class object' which means it's susceptible to all operations, but not quite, should be interpreted loosely; doesn't mean everything is first class

A first class object is an entity that can be dynamically created, destroyed, passed to a function, returned as a value, and have all the rights as other variables in the programming language have. 

Well-structured with invalid tokens:

This is a! $sentence.

Valid tokens with bad structuring:
----------------------------------

IMPORTANT STUFF
---------------------------------
The code written in other advanced scripts usually uses different modules with their appropriate functions.
For example, when you see a bunch of unrecognizable lines where you have

something.something

this is equivalent to 

module.function
