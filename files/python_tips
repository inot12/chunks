VERSION CHECK

python -V
python2 -V
python3 -V

Hola idiota, you had it done and working for 6 months

to enter a python shell type
---------------------------
$ python
or 
$ python3
or
$ pythonx.x %for a specific version
leave python shell 
------------------
quit()

Some tips
----------------------------------------------------------------
the defaul python3 was python 3.5(3.5.2) and it was preinstalled

I should figure out how to remove 3.6.5 cleanly

to se what python versions are already installed go tu /usr/bin
%manually installed versions are in /usr/local/bin
----------------------------------------------------------------

IDE
---
use any you wish, e.g. PyCharm etc.
YOU CAN ALSO USE A TEXT EDITOR AND RUN THE FOLLOWING COMMAND IN TERMINAL
$ python filename.py

IMPORTANT
there can be multiple python versions installed side by side
BUT be cautious about installing a newer python versions in place of the default os version
because things could break(SHORT VERSION: DON'T DO IT, until you're more advanced, but not even then)

INSTALLATION
------------
if the installation fails, try installing the required dependencies, how to find them?
for python3.3.0 try those

    sudo apt-get install zlib1g-dev
    sudo apt-get install build-essential
    sudo apt-get install libncursesw5-dev
    sudo apt-get install libreadline5-dev
    sudo apt-get install libssl-dev
    sudo apt-get install libgdbm-dev
    sudo apt-get install libc6-dev
    sudo apt-get install libsqlite3-dev
    sudo apt-get install tk-dev
    sudo apt-get install python-support

Backtracking(procedure used to install python3.6.5)

cd /home/toni/Downloads
tar xf Python-3.6.5.tar.xz
cd Python-3.6.5 %#3

%this part is recommended in the readme
%no suffix needed because you positioned yourself in the correct directory, amirite #3
./configure
make
make test
sudo make install

make test
sudo apt purge python
sudo apt install python



python README summary
----------------------------------------
----------------------------------------
On Unix, Linux, BSD, macOS, and Cygwin::

    ./configure
    make
    make test
    sudo make install

This will install Python as python3.


Testing
-------

To test the interpreter, type ``make test`` in the top-level directory.  The
test set produces some output.  You can generally ignore the messages about
skipped tests due to optional features which can't be imported.  If a message
is printed about a failed test or a traceback or core dump is produced,
something is wrong.

By default, tests are prevented from overusing resources like disk space and
memory.  To enable these tests, run ``make testall``.

If any tests fail, you can re-run the failing test(s) in verbose mode::

    make test TESTOPTS="-v test_that_failed"

Installing multiple versions
----------------------------

On Unix and Mac systems if you intend to install multiple versions of Python
using the same installation prefix (``--prefix`` argument to the configure
script) you must take care that your primary python executable is not
overwritten by the installation of a different version.  All files and
directories installed using ``make altinstall`` contain the major and minor
version and can thus live side-by-side.  ``make install`` also creates
``${prefix}/bin/python3`` which refers to ``${prefix}/bin/pythonX.Y``.  If you
intend to install multiple versions using the same prefix you must decide which
version (if any) is your "primary" version.  Install that version using ``make
install``.  Install all other versions using ``make altinstall``.

For example, if you want to install Python 2.7, 3.5, and 3.6 with 3.6 being the
primary version, you would execute ``make install`` in your 3.6 build directory
and ``make altinstall`` in the others.

=========================
Python 3.7.0 installation
-------------------------
-------------------------
source:https://tecadmin.net/install-python-3-7-on-ubuntu-linuxmint/


Step 1 – Prerequsiteis

Use the following command to install prerequisites for Python before installing it.

sudo apt-get install build-essential checkinstall
sudo apt-get install libreadline-gplv2-dev libncursesw5-dev libssl-dev \
    libsqlite3-dev tk-dev libgdbm-dev libc6-dev libbz2-dev

Step 2 – Download Python 3.7

Download Python using following command from python official site. You can also download latest version in place of specified below.

%cd /usr/src 
%don't have the permission, so change that to downloads
cd /home/toni/Downloads
wget wget https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.7.0/Python-3.7.0.tgz

Now extract the downloaded package.

!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
IMPORTATNT
extract without the sudo command!!!!!!!
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
%sudo tar xzf Python-3.7.0.tgz

tar xzf Python-3.7.0.tgz

Step 3 – Compile Python Source

Use below set of commands to compile python source code on your system using altinstall.

cd Python-3.7.0
%had to get the dependencies before configure and install

sudo apt-get install libffi-dev

sudo ./configure --enable-optimizations
sudo make altinstall

%tip, use

sudo -H make altinstall

make altinstall is used to prevent replacing the default python binary file /usr/bin/python.
Step 4 – Check Python Version

Check the latest version installed of python using below command

python3.7 -V

Python-3.7.0


Pycharm
------------------
------------------
cd /home/toni/software/pycharm-community-2018.2.4/bin %this is an example, cd should be to the directory where pycharm.sh is located
./pycharm.sh



=======================================
Changing default python3 version
=======================================
%the default was 3.6.5 after an uncomplete 3.6.5 installation
$ python3
%this would result in 3.6.5 opening
%after installing 3.7.0 the goal is to set python3 to open 3.7.0 ver by default

Procedure
---------
1)try to update alternatives

%sudo update-alternatives --config python

% This ill show you an error:

% $ update-alternatives: error: no alternatives for python3 

2)You need to update your update-alternatives
---------------------------------------------
IMPORTANT STEP, BE CAREFUL

%the first path has to be to the directory where the python versions are installed
%for me it is /usr/local/bin
%since i wanted to update python3, this must be referenced, for 'python' reference python
%the second path points to the python version exe to be updated
%the number at the end specifies the order? default version?
%NOTE:for the exe use ONLY PYTHONx.x version, not PYTHONx.x.x

$ sudo update-alternatives --install /usr/local/bin/python3 python3 /usr/local/bin/python3.6 1

$ sudo update-alternatives --install /usr/local/bin/python3 python3 /usr/local/bin/python3.7 2

3)set the default version
%to 3.7.0

$ sudo update-alternatives  --set python3 /usr/local/bin/python3.7

or

$ sudo update-alternatives --config python3

%and choose the desired version by typig the selection number
or


KEEP A LOOK OUT ON spyder IDE
#scientific environment with useful shit


How to install different packages?modules?
==========================================
./.local/lib/python3.7/site-packages (0.29.6)   # this is the package download directory

python3 -m pip install --user numpy scipy matplotlib
-----------------------------

To use SfePy the following packages have to be installed:

C compiler suite: Guess gcc should work, command g++
NumPy
Any python3.x version
Cython -  Cython: the ideal language for writing glue code for external C/C++ libraries, and for fast C modules that speed up the execution of Python code.


Also install all the following packages:
========================================

sudo apt-get install python-scipy python-matplotlib python-tables python-pyparsing libsuitesparse-dev python-setuptools mayavi2 python-dev ipython python-sympy cython python-sparse
==================================================================================================================================================

OK the above command works, it gets everything required, but I think this works with python2, su use the python command, not python3
====================================================================================================================================

but when running the run_tests.py this cannot execute, gets an abor error

use the :

python3 -m pip install --user

And install all the packages one by one

pip install --user cython   # this was missing, so had to install it

NOTE; THE FOLLOWING ARE NOT FOUND:

libsuitesparse -dev
mayavi2     # use just 'mayavi' instead, this will download some packages, guess it should work, got one fail, but i guess it should work

python-dev


    Pyparsing,
    SciPy,
    scikit-umfpack for enabling UMFPACK solver for SciPy >= 0.14.0,
    Matplotlib for various plots, GTKAgg for live plotting via log.py,
    PyTables for storing results in HDF5 files,
    SymPy for some tests and functions,
    Mayavi for postproc.py,
    Pysparse for additional eigenvalue problem solvers (currently available for Python 2.7.x only),
    igakit for script/gen_iga_patch.py - simple IGA domain generator,
    petsc4py and mpi4py for running parallel examples and using parallel solvers from PETSc,
    pymetis for mesh partitioning using Metis,
    wxPython for better IPython integration.


From the list, didn't manage to get:

scikit-umfpack
pytables, but tables works above so it should be covered
pysparse, but it's only for python2
igakit, but should be already be there
petsc4py, mpi4py, but should already be there
pymetis
wxpython

To install sfepy, build it from source:

download a source from:   https://sfepy.org/doc-devel/_static/downloads.php

unzip it

change cd to the unzipped directory
cd Downloads/sfepy-2019.1/

type the command
python3 setup.py build_ext --inplace

# went this route, it's recommended

Finally to install, systemwide use 

sudo python3 setup.py install

The install directory will be

/usr/local/lib/python3.7/site-packages/sfepy-2019.1-py3.7-linux-x86_64.egg

then test the sfepy installation

python3 ./run_tests.py

python3 sfepy-run run_tests --raise tests/test_functions.py     # remember to remove the <> signs otherwise you'll get and error

The raise shows there is a problem with importing numpy, guess this shouldn't be a concern.

=====================================================================
Okay, general rule:

Istall all prerequisites and required packages with

python3 -m pip install --user       <package name>

or just 

pip3 install --user

Then if the command for installing the desired module is not working
INSTALL FROM SOURCE


The packages installation folder.
/usr/local/lib/python3.7/site-packages

OK, NOW FINALLY FOUND THE SOLUTION

INSTALL MINICONDA3 X64 AND USE THIS TO GET ALL THE PACKAGES

Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh

To install type
$ bash Miniconda3-4.5.12-Linux-x86_64.sh 

When prompted to edit ~bashrc do so, type yes

To test conda type
$ conda list    # all installed conda packages should be installed

To update conda type:

$ conda update conda

To install packages type

conda install <package_name>
====================================================================


SfePy

Depending on your IPython usage, you can customize your default profile or create a SfePy specific new one as follows:

    Create a new SfePy profile:

    ipython profile create sfepy

    Open the ~/.ipython/profile_sfepy/ipython_config.py file in a text editor and add/edit after the c = get_config() line:

    exec_lines = [
        'import numpy as nm',
        'import matplotlib as mpl',
        'mpl.use("WXAgg")',
    #
    # Add your preferred SfePy customization here...
    #
    ]

    c.InteractiveShellApp.exec_lines = exec_lines
    c.TerminalIPythonApp.gui = 'wx'
    c.TerminalInteractiveShell.colors = 'Linux' # NoColor, Linux, or LightBG

    Please note, that generally it is not recommended to use star (*) imports here.

=======================================
    Run the customized IPython shell:

    ipython --profile=sfepy
=======================================

To invoke sfepy from the command line use:

Those commands should be invoked in the directory of the <problem_description_file>
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

$ python <path/to/installed/simple.py> <problem_description_file>


i.e

$ python3 /home/toni/Downloads/sfepy-2019.1/simple.py poisson_short_syntax.py 

This command is better

sfepy-run simple <problem_description_file>

note that the file can be located anywhere on the system

To see the postprocessor type.
The cd has to be the directory of the file to be postprocessed.

$ python3 /home/toni/Downloads/sfepy-2019.1/postproc.py cylinder.vtk
